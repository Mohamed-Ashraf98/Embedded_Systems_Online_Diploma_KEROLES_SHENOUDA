- lab_2 : toggle LED connected to pin 13 in port A on STM32F103C6

>> change SYSCLK, HCLK, PCLK1 and PCLK2 with defferent frequencies
	> APB1 Bus frequency 32 MHz
	> APB2 Bus frequency 64 MHz
	> AHB    frequency 64 MHz
	> SYSCLK frequency 64 MHz
	> use only internal HSI_RC

>> use EXTI line 0 connected to GPIO Port A pin 0 to toggle the LED
